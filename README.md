## üìñ Overview

Motivated by the significant impact of Stroke (CVA) and the high cost of conventional robotic therapies, this project aimed to develop a low-cost, open-source, omnidirectional prototype for the active rehabilitation of the upper limb. [50, 56]

The device, functionally inspired by the commercial Armotion system, allows a patient to control its movement by applying force to a handle. [117] It uses a set of Mecanum wheels for omnidirectional mobility and a force-sensing system to interpret the user's intent. [51, 118] The processed data is then used to move the robot and can be simultaneously transmitted via Bluetooth to a computer, emulating a mouse for interaction with therapeutic games (gamification). [291, 812]

This work delivers a validated, open-source platform, demonstrating the feasibility of more accessible assistive technologies and inviting multidisciplinary collaboration for its evolution into a complete clinical tool. [53, 59]

## ‚ú® Features

* **Omnidirectional Movement:** Utilizes four Mecanum wheels driven by NEMA 17 stepper motors, allowing for fluid, planar movement in any direction (X-Y plane) without needing to reorient the chassis. [258, 259]
* **Force-Based Active Control:** The robot operates in an active mode, where the speed and direction of movement are proportional to the force applied by the user on a central joystick. [948, 995]
* **Smooth Motion Profile:** Implements a non-linear, sigmoidal control law using a hyperbolic tangent (`tanh`) function to ensure smooth acceleration and deceleration, enhancing patient safety and comfort. [817, 818, 855]
* **Real-Time Processing:** Built on an ESP32 microcontroller running the FreeRTOS real-time operating system, guaranteeing responsive and deterministic control. [254, 638]
* **Wireless Connectivity:** Features Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to connect to external devices, emulating a Human Interface Device (HID) mouse for immediate visual feedback and interaction with rehabilitation software. [291, 940]
* **Open Source:** All design files, including firmware source code, 3D models for the chassis, and electronic diagrams, are publicly available to encourage collaboration and further development. [1006]

## üíª Software

The embedded software is built using the **PlatformIO** framework within VSCode. [625] This ensures a reproducible build environment by managing exact versions of libraries and the ESP32 hardware platform (`espressif32@6.2.0`). [626, 628]

### Architecture
The architecture is modular and built upon the **FreeRTOS** real-time operating system to handle concurrent tasks efficiently. [621, 638]

* **Key Modules:**
    * `celulas.h`: Manages data acquisition and processing from the HX711 load cells. [622]
    * `motor.h`: Handles the control logic, kinematics, and pulse generation for the stepper motors. [622]
    * `robomouse.h`: Manages the BLE connection and HID mouse emulation. [622]
* **Real-Time Tasks:**
    1.  **Motor Control (`ContrMotores`):** A high-priority task running every 2 ms to ensure fluid motor updates. [717]
    2.  **Sensor Reading (`atuador`):** A task dedicated to reading and processing data from the load cells. [713, 1419]
    3.  **Bluetooth (`ContrMouse`):** A lower-priority task that sends cursor movement data over BLE. [715]
    4.  **LED Status (`ledTask`):** A simple task to provide visual feedback on the system's state. [713]

The source code is located in the `/src` directory and is organized into the modules described above. The full source code can also be found in Appendix A of the thesis. [1137]

    * Build and upload the firmware using the PlatformIO toolbar (click the "Upload" arrow icon).

## üéõÔ∏è Calibration

Before operation, two critical calibration procedures must be performed to ensure accuracy and safety.

### 1. A4988 Stepper Driver Calibration
This procedure sets the maximum current for the stepper motors to prevent overheating. [531]

1.  **Calculate V_REF:** The target current was set to **1.0A** (80% of the motor's 1.3A rating). [538, 541] With 0.1Œ© sense resistors on the A4988 modules, the target reference voltage (V_REF) is **0.8V (800mV)**. [542, 544]
2.  **Adjust Potentiometer:**
    * Power the logic and motor circuits. **Do not connect the motors yet.** [547, 551]
    * Using a multimeter, measure the voltage between the `GND` pin and the metal top of the potentiometer on one of the A4988 drivers. [568]
    * Slowly turn the potentiometer with a small screwdriver until the multimeter reads **0.800V**. [574, 575]
    * Repeat this process for all four drivers. [530]

### 2. Load Cell (HX711) Calibration
This procedure determines the calibration factor needed to convert the raw ADC readings into grams. [581]

1.  **Load Calibration Sketch:** Use a standard HX711 calibration sketch (like the one found in the `HX711_ADC` library examples). [584]
2.  **Run the Procedure:**
    * Upload and run the sketch on the ESP32 with the load cells connected.
    * Open the Serial Monitor. Follow the on-screen instructions. [596]
    * First, the program will perform a tare (zeroing) with no weight on the platform. [597]
    * Next, place a **known weight** (e.g., 5 kg) on the sensor platform. [602]
    * Enter the known weight value (e.g., `5000.0` for grams) into the serial monitor. [606]
    * The sketch will calculate and display a new calibration factor. [609]
3.  **Update Firmware:** Record the calibration factors for each of the four load cells and update the following `#define` constants in `src/celulas.h`: [614]
    ```cpp
    #define calValueCellXp 43.53 // Replace with your value
    #define calValueCellXn 41.06 // Replace with your value
    #define calValueCellYp 43.22 // Replace with your value
    #define calValueCellYn 43.50 // Replace with your value
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Operate

1.  **Power On:** Turn on the main power switch. The onboard LED will blink during initialization. [934, 935]
2.  **Ready State:** The LED will turn solid, indicating that initialization is complete and the device is ready. [937] The BLE service is now advertising. [939]
3.  **Connect via Bluetooth:** On a computer, search for Bluetooth devices and pair with **"Rehabilitation Robot"**. The device will be recognized as a standard mouse. [940]
4.  **Begin Therapy:**
    * Place the robot on a flat, smooth surface.
    * The user places their hand on the joystick/handle and applies force in the desired direction of movement. [946]
    * The robot will move across the surface, and the computer's cursor will move in sync, allowing interaction with games or other rehabilitation software. [941]

## üöß Limitations & Future Work

While the prototype successfully validates the core concept, several limitations were identified that pave the way for future improvements. [962]

### Current Limitations
* **Active Mode Only:** The current design is only suitable for patients who can actively generate force. It does not support passive (robot-led) or active-assistive modes for patients with more severe impairment. [995, 998]
* **Rotational Drift:** The device experiences minor, unintentional rotations around its central axis during movement, which can accumulate over time. [966]
* **Sensor Drift:** The load cells can exhibit drift and hysteresis, especially under traction forces, preventing a perfect return to zero. [972, 977]

### Future Development Roadmap
The evolution of this project depends on a multidisciplinary effort. Key areas for future work include:

1.  **Hardware Enhancements:**
    * **Orientation Control:** Integrate an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) (e.g., MPU6050) to implement a closed-loop control system that corrects rotational drift. [968]
    * **Passive/Assistive Modes:** Add encoders to the motors for position feedback, enabling the implementation of passive and active-assistive therapeutic modes. [1012]
    * **Sensor Redesign:** Explore bidirectional force sensors or a new mechanical arrangement to eliminate sensor drift. [981]
2.  **Software Development:**
    * **Gamification Suite:** Develop a dedicated suite of therapeutic games that leverage the device's IHM for engaging and measurable rehabilitation exercises. [1009]
3.  **Clinical Validation:**
    * Collaborate with physiotherapists and occupational therapists to conduct usability tests and controlled clinical trials to validate the device's therapeutic effectiveness. [1003, 1013]
